To get the list of svn users you need to have a full checkout of the svn repository you will be importing.

Next switch into the root directory of the checkedout working copy.

Next run this command and redirect to a file:
svn log | grep '^r[0-9]' | awk '{print $3}' | sort | uniq > svn-users.txt

mvn clean package to build test.jar which is shaded to include all of the dependencies.

java -jar test.jar svn-users.txt git-users.txt example.org

This will create a file 'git-users.txt' with entries like this:

username = FirstName LastName <username@example.org>

Then you can initalize the svn clone like this:

git svn clone -A git-users.txt https://svn-repo.org/...
